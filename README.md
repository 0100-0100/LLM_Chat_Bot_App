# LLM_Chat_Bot_App
This repository is the final project for the Udemy Course: The Local LLM Crash Course - Build an AI Chatbot in 2 hours!

On this course we understood a minimal python stack for creating a chatbot with the use of hugging face's text models and chainlit a Python framework for the web application front-end for conversation interactions with an LLM similar to OpenAI's UI for ChatGPT.
